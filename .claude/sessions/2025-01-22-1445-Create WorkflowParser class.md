# Create WorkflowParser class
*Session started: January 22, 2025 at 14:45*

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: 14:45
- **Task**: Create WorkflowParser class for the JSON workflow engine

## Goals
- [ ] Review workflow engine specifications in `.kiro/specs/json-workflow-engine/`
- [ ] Implement WorkflowParser class with JSON schema validation
- [ ] Add semantic validation for workflow definitions
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for the parser
- [ ] Ensure proper error reporting with line/column numbers

## Progress

### Completed (14:50)
- ✅ Created WorkflowParser class in `/server/src/parser/WorkflowParser.ts`
- ✅ Implemented JSON schema validation using Ajv
- ✅ Added semantic validation for node references and edge consistency
- ✅ Implemented edge route parsing with support for:
  - String routes (direct node references)
  - Array routes (sequence of nodes)
  - Nested node configurations
  - Optional edges (marked with `?` suffix)
- ✅ Created comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
- ✅ Created workflow JSON schema in `/server/src/schemas/workflow-schema.json`
- ✅ Wrote comprehensive test suite with 15 tests - all passing
- ✅ Added ajv dependency and fixed TypeScript import issues
- ✅ Build successful, tests passing

### Key Implementation Details
- Parser validates workflows in two phases: structural (JSON schema) then semantic
- Supports parameter separation from edge routes
- Handles nested node configurations recursively
- Returns ParsedWorkflow with clean structure for execution engine
- Error messages include path information for debugging
