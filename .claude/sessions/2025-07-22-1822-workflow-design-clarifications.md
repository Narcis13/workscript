# Workflow Design Clarifications Session - 2025-07-22

## Session Overview
- **Start Time**: 2025-07-22 18:22
- **Session Name**: Workflow Design Clarifications
- **Focus**: Clarifying design aspects of the JSON workflow engine

## Goals
- Review and clarify workflow system design specifications
- Address any ambiguities in the current implementation
- Ensure alignment between specifications and implementation
- Identify any design gaps or areas needing refinement

## Progress

### Major Design Clarification Resolved
- **Issue**: Found significant mismatch between design specification and implementation
  - Design spec: `workflow: NodeConfiguration[]` (array-based)
  - Implementation: `workflow: Record<string, NodeConfiguration>` (object-based)
- **Resolution**: Updated implementation to match the array-based design specification
  - Updated shared types to use `NodeConfiguration[]`
  - Modified workflow-schema.json to expect array structure
  - Updated WorkflowParser to handle array-based workflows
  - Converted all tests to use the new array format
  - Added support for number and boolean values in NodeConfigValue
- **Result**: All tests passing, implementation now fully aligned with design specs
