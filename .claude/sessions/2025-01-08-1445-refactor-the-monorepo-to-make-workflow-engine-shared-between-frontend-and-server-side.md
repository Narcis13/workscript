### üöß **Problems Encountered & Solutions**

#### **Challenge**: Ensuring Backward Compatibility
- **Problem**: Need to migrate engine while maintaining existing server functionality
- **Solution**: Designed gradual migration approach with shared imports, ensuring server continues to work

#### **Challenge**: Node Organization Strategy  
- **Problem**: Determining optimal distribution of nodes across packages
- **Solution**: Created three-tier system based on dependency analysis (universal/server/client)

#### **Challenge**: Environment Detection
- **Problem**: NodeRegistry needs to load appropriate nodes per environment
- **Solution**: Enhanced NodeRegistry with `discoverFromPackages()` method and source tracking

### üì¶ **Dependencies Analysis**
- **Shared Package Requirements**: Identified need for `ajv` and `glob` dependencies
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Confirmed core engine has minimal dependencies ideal for sharing
- **Environment Isolation**: Ensured environment-specific dependencies remain in appropriate packages

- **Import Patterns**: Defined new import patterns for shared engine usage

### üéì **Lessons Learned**

#### **Architecture Insights**
- **Current Implementation Strength**: The existing server-only engine is exceptionally well-designed for migration
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal external dependencies make multi-environment execution feasible
- **Modular Design Benefits**: Clean component separation enables easy redistribution

#### **Migration Strategy**
- **Planning First**: Comprehensive planning prevents architectural mistakes during implementation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Critical for production systems - must maintain existing functionality
- **Environment Awareness**: Different environments have different capabilities and constraints

#### **Documentation Value**
- **Specification Alignment**: Keeping all docs in sync prevents confusion and implementation errors
- **Practical Examples**: Code samples are essential for developer adoption
- **Migration Guidance**: Step-by-step instructions reduce implementation risk

### üéØ **What Wasn't Completed**
- **Actual Migration Implementation**: This session focused on analysis and planning - no code migration performed
- **Testing Strategy Implementation**: Test migration not performed, only planned
- **Node Implementation**: No actual nodes created, only examples and patterns defined

### üí° **Tips for Future Developers**

#### **Migration Implementation**
1. **Follow Phase 1 First**: Complete all Phase 1 migration tasks before implementing new features
2. **Test Extensively**: Ensure existing server tests pass after each migration step
3. **Incremental Approach**: Migrate one component at a time to isolate issues

#### **Node Development**  
1. **Environment-First Thinking**: Always consider where a node will run before implementation
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Prefer universal nodes when possible for maximum reusability
3. **Testing Across Environments**: Test universal nodes in all supported environments

#### **Architecture Maintenance**
1. **Documentation Sync**: Keep specs updated when making architectural changes
2. **Example Currency**: Update code examples when APIs change
3. **Migration Documentation**: Document any deviations from the planned migration

### üîÑ **Next Session Priorities**
1. **Begin Phase 1 Migration**: Start with moving core engine components to shared package
2. **Package Dependencies**: Update shared package.json with required dependencies
3. **Create Node Directories**: Set up the distributed node directory structure
4. **Enhanced NodeRegistry**: Implement multi-package discovery functionality

### üìã **Migration Readiness**
