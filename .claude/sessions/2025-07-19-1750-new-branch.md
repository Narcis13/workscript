### Update - 2025-07-19 18:53

**Summary**: Applied software development framework to generate project artifacts

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: specs.md
- Added: .claude/ (session management)
- Added: .kiro/specs/json-workflow-engine-v2/ (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
- Added: TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
- Current branch: core-changes (commit: 3a850f0)

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Read the updated specs.md file
- ✓ Completed: Apply requirements generation template
- ✓ Completed: Apply design generation template
- ✓ Completed: Apply tasks generation template
- ✓ Completed: Create folder .kiro/specs/json-workflow-engine-v2

**Details**: Successfully created a new branch 'core-changes' and applied the .kiro/framework software development framework to the updated specs.md file. Generated three foundational documents:
1. requirements.md - 25 comprehensive requirements with user stories and WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria
2. design.md - Complete technical architecture with TypeScript interfaces, Mermaid diagrams, and component specifications
3. tasks.md - 34 actionable implementation tasks organized into phases and linked to requirements

The framework successfully transformed the workflow engine specification into structured development artifacts ready for implementation.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Successfully Applied Software Development Framework**
   - Utilized the .kiro/framework templates to transform specs.md into structured artifacts
   - Generated comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of the workflow engine

2. **Created Complete Project Documentation**
   - **Requirements Document**: 25 user stories with testable WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria
   - **Design Document**: Full technical architecture including TypeScript interfaces, Mermaid diagrams, and component specifications
   - **Tasks Document**: 34 actionable implementation tasks organized by phases and linked to requirements

3. **Established Version Control Workflow**
   - Created and switched to `core-changes` feature branch
   - Made initial commit with comprehensive message
   - Pushed branch to GitHub with upstream tracking
   - Confirmed proper Git workflow for feature development

### Features Documented (Not Implemented)
- WorkflowNode abstract class architecture
- ExecutionContext and state management design
- Edge-based routing system
- JSON workflow validation schema
- Node registry and discovery mechanism
- Loop constructs and iteration control
- Error handling and recovery strategies
- REST API design with Hono framework
- Monorepo structure with shared types

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Git Divergence**: Initially helped resolve diverged main branch through merge
   - Solution: Used `git pull --no-rebase` to merge remote changes
2. **Session Management**: First time using Claude session tracking
   - Solution: Successfully created session tracking system in .claude/sessions/

### Configuration Changes
- Added .claude/sessions/ directory for development session tracking
- Created .kiro/specs/json-workflow-engine-v2/ directory structure

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- None in this session (documentation only)

### Deployment Steps Taken
- None (planning phase only)

### Breaking Changes or Important Findings
- The workflow engine design requires Bun runtime (not Node.js)
- Monorepo structure necessitates proper workspace configuration
- State management needs careful consideration for concurrent execution

### Lessons Learned
1. The .kiro/framework provides excellent structure for transforming specs into actionable documents
2. Comprehensive requirements with WHEN/THEN format enable clear testing criteria
3. Mermaid diagrams in design docs provide visual architecture understanding
4. Linking tasks to requirements ensures complete coverage

### What Wasn't Completed
- No actual code implementation (this was a planning/documentation session)
- Goals section was never filled in with specific objectives
- No pull request created yet for the changes

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Start Implementation**: Follow the tasks.md file sequentially - begin with monorepo setup (Task 1)
2. **Reference Design**: Keep design.md open while implementing - it has all TypeScript interfaces ready
3. **Test Early**: Each requirement has acceptance criteria - write tests as you implement
4. **Use Existing Work**: Much of the groundwork is already done in the server/ directory
5. **Create PR Early**: Consider creating a draft PR for visibility and early feedback
6. **Follow Patterns**: The codebase already has established patterns - follow them
7. **Ask Questions**: If requirements seem unclear, the acceptance criteria provide clarity

### Next Steps Recommended
1. Fill in session goals before starting next session
2. Begin with Task 1: Initialize monorepo structure
3. Set up development environment with Bun
4. Create draft pull request for work visibility
5. Implement core types from design.md in shared package

This session successfully established the foundation for implementing the JSON workflow engine v2 with comprehensive documentation and a clear implementation path.
