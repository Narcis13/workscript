- Maintains singleton and non-singleton registration patterns

#### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- **207 tests passing** (90 shared + 117 server)
- Migrated all tests to appropriate packages
- Maintained full test coverage throughout migration
- All integration tests passing across environments

### 🛠️ Features Implemented

#### Core Engine Features:
- ✅ ExecutionEngine with multi-environment support
- ✅ WorkflowParser with AST generation
- ✅ StateManager with persistence adapter support
- ✅ NodeRegistry with distributed node architecture
- ✅ Browser compatibility layer
- ✅ Multi-environment workflow execution

#### Node Architecture:
- ✅ Universal nodes (zero dependencies)
- ✅ Server-specific nodes (filesystem, auth, database)
- ✅ Client-specific nodes (DOM, localStorage, fetch)
- ✅ Automatic node discovery by environment

#### Development Experience:
- ✅ Enhanced dev commands with concurrency
- ✅ Hot reloading across all packages
- ✅ Proper build order (shared → server → client)
- ✅ Comprehensive test scripts
- ✅ Browser compatibility in Vite

### 🔧 Problems Encountered & Solutions

#### 1. Browser Compatibility Issues
- **Problem:** Node.js modules (crypto, fs, path, glob) being bundled for browser
- **Solution:** Conditional imports and Vite externalization
- **Code:** `if (typeof globalThis !== 'undefined' && 'window' in globalThis)`

#### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Problem:** Import paths broken after moving files
- **Solution:** Updated all import references systematically
- **Impact:** Fixed imports from `../../../shared/src/types` to `../types`

#### 3. Test Failures After Migration  
- **Problem:** NodeRegistry test expected metadata without source field
- **Solution:** Updated test to expect `source: 'universal'` field
- **Result:** All 207 tests passing

#### 4. Build System Configuration
- **Problem:** Cross-package imports not working properly
- **Solution:** Updated workspace dependencies and build scripts
- **Enhancement:** Added proper dependency order and hot reloading

### 🔄 Breaking Changes
- **None!** - Migration maintained full backward compatibility
- All existing server functionality preserved
- Client package can now execute workflows in browser
- Enhanced APIs are additive, not breaking

### 📦 Dependencies Added/Removed

#### Added Dependencies:
- **Shared package:**
  - `ajv: ^8.12.0` - JSON schema validation
  - `glob: ^11.0.0` - File pattern matching
- **Client package:**
  - `shared: workspace:*` - Local shared package dependency

#### Configuration Changes:
- Updated `vitest.config.ts` in shared package
- Enhanced `vite.config.ts` in client for Node.js module externalization
- Updated root `package.json` with concurrent dev scripts

### 🎯 Architecture After Migration

```

### 🧪 Deployment Steps Taken
1. ✅ All packages build successfully
2. ✅ Tests pass in all environments
3. ✅ Development scripts work with hot reloading
4. ✅ Browser compatibility verified
5. ✅ Multi-environment node discovery functional

### 💡 Lessons Learned

#### 1. Browser vs Node.js Compatibility
- Always use conditional imports for environment-specific modules
- Vite externalization is crucial for Node.js modules in browser builds
- TypeScript needs careful handling of global objects (`window`, `globalThis`)

#### 2. Monorepo Package Dependencies
- Workspace dependencies require proper ordering in build scripts
- Hot reloading needs careful configuration for cross-package changes
- Test environments need separate configurations per package

#### 3. Migration Strategy
- Systematic phase-by-phase approach prevents breaking changes
- Comprehensive testing at each step ensures stability
- Maintaining backward compatibility requires careful API design

#### 4. Multi-Environment Architecture
- Conditional code execution based on environment detection
- Source tracking for nodes enables proper environment filtering
- Universal nodes should have zero external dependencies

### ✅ What Was Completed
1. ✅ **Complete migration from server-only to shared-first architecture**
2. ✅ **Multi-environment node discovery and execution**
3. ✅ **Browser compatibility for shared engine**
4. ✅ **All 207 tests passing across packages**
5. ✅ **Enhanced development scripts with hot reloading**
6. ✅ **Distributed node architecture implementation**
7. ✅ **Comprehensive build system updates**
8. ✅ **Working React workflow demo component**

### 🎯 Tips for Future Developers

#### 1. Adding New Nodes
- **Universal nodes:** Place in `/shared/nodes/` with zero dependencies
- **Server nodes:** Place in `/server/nodes/` for Node.js-specific functionality
- **Client nodes:** Place in `/client/nodes/` for browser APIs
- Use NodeRegistry's `discoverFromPackages()` for automatic loading

#### 2. Cross-Environment Development
- Test workflows in both server and client environments
- Use conditional imports for environment-specific code
- Leverage NodeRegistry's environment filtering

#### 3. Build & Development
- Always run `bun run build` after shared package changes
- Use `bun run dev` for concurrent development across packages
- Run `bun run test` to verify all packages before deployment

#### 4. Browser Compatibility
- Keep shared package free of Node.js-specific dependencies
- Use Vite externalization for any Node.js modules
- Test workflows in browser environment during development

### 🚀 Ready for Production
The migration is **complete and production-ready** with:
- ✅ **207 tests passing**
- ✅ **All packages building successfully** 
- ✅ **Multi-environment workflow execution**
- ✅ **Zero breaking changes**
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation updated**

**Next Steps:** Ready for feature development on the new shared-first architecture!
