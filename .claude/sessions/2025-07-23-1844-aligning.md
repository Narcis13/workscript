- **Tasks Remaining**: 0
- **Completed Tasks**:
  1. ‚úÖ Read current requirements.md from specs folder
  2. ‚úÖ Read current design.md from specs folder  
  3. ‚úÖ Examine current codebase structure and types
  4. ‚úÖ Analyze changes made to node configurations and types
  5. ‚úÖ Update design.md to align with code and requirements

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. **Design Document Alignment** üéØ
- **Fully updated** `.kiro/specs/json-workflow-engine/design.md` to be 100% aligned with current codebase
- **Maintained completeness** - kept all planned features while accurately reflecting current implementation status
- **Added implementation status notes** for components not yet built (ExecutionEngine, StateManager, ErrorHandler)
- **Updated all code examples** to match actual TypeScript interfaces and implementations

#### 2. **Type System Analysis** üîç
- **Identified key differences** between design doc and actual implementation
- **Documented current type structure** from `shared/src/types/index.ts`:
  - `WorkflowStep` as union type (string | object)
  - `ParameterValue` with comprehensive primitive and complex types
  - `EdgeRoute` supporting string, array, and nested configurations
  - `EdgeMap` as simple `Record<string, any>` (vs. complex function-based type in original design)

#### 3. **Implementation Assessment** ‚úÖ
- **Evaluated Task 7 (WorkflowParser)** completion status: **100% COMPLETE**
- **Confirmed comprehensive implementation** including:
  - JSON schema validation with Ajv
  - Node reference resolution with registry validation
  - Configuration parsing with parameter/edge separation
  - Nested configuration handling
  - Comprehensive error reporting with precise location tracking
  - 510+ lines of test coverage

#### 4. **Codebase Structure Documentation** üìö
- **Mapped current monorepo structure** following bhvr stack (Bun + Hono + Vite + React)
- **Documented implemented components**:
  - ‚úÖ NodeRegistry - fully implemented with discovery, validation, and lifecycle management
  - ‚úÖ WorkflowParser - complete with schema validation and semantic analysis
  - ‚è≥ ExecutionEngine - planned for implementation
  - ‚è≥ StateManager - planned for implementation
  - ‚è≥ ErrorHandler - planned for implementation

### Features Implemented
- **Comprehensive workflow parsing** with JSON schema validation
- **Advanced node configuration parsing** with `?` suffix edge detection
- **Nested configuration support** for inline node definitions
- **Robust error reporting** with detailed path and code information
- **Node registry system** with filesystem discovery and metadata validation
- **Type-safe interfaces** across shared package for consistency

### Problems Encountered and Solutions

#### Problem 1: **Design-Code Misalignment**
- **Issue**: Original design.md contained outdated type definitions and missing implementation details
- **Solution**: Systematic review and update of all interfaces to match actual codebase
- **Impact**: Design document now serves as accurate reference for current and planned features

#### Problem 2: **Type System Complexity**
- **Issue**: EdgeMap was defined as complex function-based type in design but implemented as simple Record
- **Solution**: Updated design to reflect actual implementation while maintaining planned execution engine compatibility
- **Impact**: Consistent type definitions between design and implementation

#### Problem 3: **Implementation Status Clarity**
- **Issue**: Design document didn't distinguish between implemented and planned features
- **Solution**: Added implementation status notes throughout design document
- **Impact**: Clear roadmap for developers on what exists vs. what needs to be built

### Breaking Changes or Important Findings

#### 1. **Type System Simplifications**
- `EdgeMap` is currently `Record<string, any>` (not function-based)
- `NodeMetadata.version` is optional (not required as in original design)
- `WorkflowStep` union type supports both simple strings and complex configurations

#### 2. **Parser Architecture**
- Two-phase validation: JSON schema followed by semantic validation
- Parameter/edge separation uses `?` suffix convention
- Comprehensive error reporting with precise location tracking

#### 3. **Current Implementation Maturity**
- **NodeRegistry**: Production-ready with comprehensive features
- **WorkflowParser**: Production-ready with full test coverage
- **Execution layer**: Not yet implemented - represents next major development phase

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- **No dependencies modified** during this session
- **Confirmed current stack**:
  - Ajv 8.x for JSON schema validation
  - Hono 4.x for server framework
  - Bun runtime with native TypeScript support

### Configuration Changes
- **No configuration changes** made during this session
- **Updated task completion status** in tasks.md to reflect Task 7 completion

### Deployment Steps Taken
- **No deployment actions** taken during this session
- **Session focused on documentation and alignment** only

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. **Importance of Specs-Driven Development**
- Having comprehensive requirements.md and design.md as foundation documents is crucial
- Regular alignment checks prevent implementation drift from original specifications
- Design documents must be living documents that evolve with implementation

#### 2. **Type System Evolution**
- Initial type designs may need refinement during implementation
- Balancing type safety with implementation simplicity is key
- Current simplified `EdgeMap` type will likely evolve when execution engine is implemented

#### 3. **Implementation Assessment Value**
- Regular evaluation of task completion against original requirements prevents scope creep
- Comprehensive test coverage (510+ lines) indicates mature, production-ready implementation
- Clear implementation status helps prioritize next development phases

### What Wasn't Completed
- **No incomplete work** from this session's scope
- **Future implementation needed**:
  - ExecutionEngine core (Task 9)
  - StateManager (Task 8) 
  - ErrorHandler (Task 12)
  - Edge routing system (Task 10)
  - Loop construct support (Task 11)

### Tips for Future Developers

#### 1. **Working with the Codebase**
- Always reference `.kiro/specs/json-workflow-engine/` for requirements and design
- Use `bun run dev` for development with hot reloading
- Tests are critical - WorkflowParser has 510+ lines showing the expected standard

#### 2. **Next Implementation Steps**
- **ExecutionEngine** should be next major component (Task 9)
- **StateManager** will be needed to support execution (Task 8)
- Current WorkflowParser provides solid foundation for execution layer

#### 3. **Type System Guidelines**
- Follow patterns established in `shared/src/types/index.ts`
- Maintain backward compatibility when evolving interfaces
- Use `?` suffix consistently for edge route identification

#### 4. **Testing Standards**
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage (WorkflowParser example: 510+ lines)
- Include both unit and integration test scenarios
- Test error conditions and edge cases thoroughly

#### 5. **Architecture Decisions**
- Current simplified type system (e.g., `EdgeMap`) may need evolution for execution engine
- Keep shared types package as single source of truth
- Maintain clean separation between parsing, registry, and execution concerns
