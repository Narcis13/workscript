### Todo Summary
- **Total Tasks**: No formal todo list was maintained during this session
- **Key Work Done**:
  - Enhanced client-side node infrastructure
  - Implemented utility nodes for UI components
  - Advanced workflow demonstration components

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Client Node Infrastructure Enhancement**
   - Extended `client/nodes/index.ts` to support additional node types
   - Created foundation for client-specific workflow nodes

2. **UI Component Nodes Created**
   - `ButtonNode.ts`: Interactive button node for workflow UI
   - `ContainerNode.ts`: Layout container node for organizing workflow elements
   - Both nodes follow the client-side node architecture pattern

3. **Advanced Workflow Components**
   - `AdvancedWorkflowDemo.tsx`: Enhanced demonstration component
   - Updated existing workflow demo components with improved functionality
   - Enhanced `Advanced.tsx` component with additional features

### Features Implemented
- **Client-Side Node Architecture**: Extended node registry for client-specific nodes
- **UI Workflow Nodes**: Interactive components that can be used within workflows
- **Advanced Demo Interface**: Comprehensive demonstration of client capabilities
- **Component Integration**: Better integration between workflow engine and React components

### Architecture Alignment
- **Multi-Environment Compatibility**: All changes support the shared architecture design
- **Client Node Placement**: New nodes correctly placed in `client/nodes/` directory
- **TypeScript Compliance**: All code follows strict TypeScript conventions
- **React Integration**: Proper integration with React 19 and modern patterns

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
- **Node Registration**: Ensured proper registration of new client nodes in the index
- **Component Architecture**: Maintained separation between workflow logic and UI presentation
- **Type Safety**: Addressed TypeScript compatibility across client components

### Configuration Changes
- Updated client node exports to include new utility nodes
- Enhanced component structure for better modularity

### What Wasn't Completed
- No formal todo tracking was established during this session
- Changes remain uncommitted (ready for review)
- Integration tests for new nodes not yet implemented

### Lessons Learned
1. **Client Node Pattern**: Established clear pattern for creating client-specific workflow nodes
2. **UI Integration**: Successful integration of workflow concepts with React components
3. **Architecture Benefits**: The shared architecture design enables clean separation of concerns

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Node Development**: Follow the established pattern in `ButtonNode.ts` and `ContainerNode.ts` for new client nodes
2. **Component Structure**: Use the `AdvancedWorkflowDemo.tsx` as a reference for complex workflow UI components
3. **Registration**: Always update `client/nodes/index.ts` when adding new client nodes
4. **Testing**: Consider implementing integration tests for client-side workflow execution
5. **Migration Context**: This work prepares the client for the upcoming shared architecture migration

### Next Steps
1. Commit the current changes to preserve the work
2. Implement tests for the new client nodes
3. Continue with Phase 1 migration tasks as outlined in CLAUDE.md
4. Consider expanding the client node library with more UI-focused nodes
