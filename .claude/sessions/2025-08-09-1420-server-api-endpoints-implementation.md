## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-08-09 14:20
**Focus:** Server API endpoints implementation

## Goals
- Implement server API endpoints for the agentic workflow engine
- Ensure proper integration with the shared workflow engine
- Follow the multi-environment architecture patterns
- Maintain compatibility with existing workflow definitions

## Progress
*Session started - ready for development tasks*

### Update - 2025-08-09 17:24 PM

**Summary**: Successfully implemented singleton NodeRegistry with automatic node discovery

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: server/src/index.ts, shared/src/registry/NodeRegistry.ts
- Modified: server/nodes/*.ts, shared/nodes/*.ts (added default exports)
- Added: server/src/services/WorkflowService.ts, server/src/test-singleton.ts
- Deleted: specs.md
- Current branch: core (commit: e7e9eb2)

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Examine current server structure and NodeRegistry implementation
- ✓ Completed: Design singleton NodeRegistry pattern for server environment  
- ✓ Completed: Implement auto-discovery of shared (universal) and server nodes
- ✓ Completed: Create initialization logic for server startup
- ✓ Completed: Test the singleton NodeRegistry instance

**Issues Encountered**:
- Initial node discovery found 0 nodes due to incorrect path resolution from server subdirectory
- Missing default exports on all node classes prevented registration
- NodeRegistry's findMonorepoRoot() method had incorrect fs module usage

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **WorkflowService Singleton**: Created comprehensive singleton service (`/server/src/services/WorkflowService.ts`)
   - Auto-initializing with lazy loading on first API call
   - Automatic discovery from both `shared/nodes/` and `server/nodes/` directories
   - Smart monorepo root detection that works from any subdirectory

2. **Enhanced NodeRegistry**: Fixed path resolution and discovery logic
   - Added monorepo root detection walking up directory tree
   - Fixed conditional fs module imports for Node.js environment
   - Enhanced debugging with detailed discovery logging

3. **Node Export Fixes**: Added missing `export default` statements to all node classes:
   - Shared nodes: MathNode, LogicNode, DataTransformNode  
   - Server nodes: AuthNode, FileSystemNode, DatabaseNode

4. **API Integration**: Updated server endpoints to use singleton WorkflowService
   - All endpoints now use `await WorkflowService.getInstance()`
   - Added new endpoints: `/nodes/:source`, `/service/info`

**Final Results**:
- ✅ 6 total nodes successfully registered (3 universal + 3 server)
- ✅ API endpoints working: `/service/info`, `/nodes/universal`, `/nodes/server`
- ✅ Confirmed recursive tree structure support with `**/*.{ts,js}` pattern
- ✅ Perfect singleton behavior with same instance across calls

**Production Ready**: The singleton NodeRegistry is now fully operational and ready for workflow API implementations.
