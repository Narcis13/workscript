# Triggers and Hooks Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a comprehensive triggers and hooks system for the agentic workflow engine that enables:

1. **Workflow Lifecycle Hooks** - Attach logic to workflow execution phases
2. **Node Execution Triggers** - React to node execution events  
3. **State Change Triggers** - React to state modifications
4. **Custom Event System** - Publish/subscribe for custom events
5. **Conditional Triggers** - Execute hooks based on conditions
6. **Multi-Environment Support** - Works in server, client, and universal contexts

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Core Hook System (`/shared/src/hooks/`)
- **HookManager** - Central hook registration and execution
- **Hook Types** - Workflow, node, state, and custom event hooks
- **Trigger Conditions** - Conditional execution with filter functions
- **Hook Priority** - Execution order control
- **Async Hook Support** - Both sync and async hook execution

### 2. Trigger System (`/shared/src/triggers/`)
- **TriggerEngine** - Event detection and hook invocation
- **Event Emitter** - Centralized event publishing
- **Trigger Conditions** - When/if logic for hook execution
- **State Watchers** - Monitor state changes with diff detection
- **Performance Monitoring** - Hook execution metrics

### 3. Integration Points
- **ExecutionEngine** integration for workflow lifecycle hooks
- **StateManager** integration for state change triggers
- **NodeRegistry** integration for node-level hooks
- **Event propagation** across multi-environment architecture

### 4. Hook Categories

#### Workflow Lifecycle Hooks
- `workflow:before-start` - Before workflow execution begins
- `workflow:after-start` - After workflow initialization
- `workflow:before-end` - Before workflow completion
- `workflow:after-end` - After workflow completion
- `workflow:on-error` - When workflow fails
- `workflow:on-timeout` - When workflow times out

#### Node Execution Hooks
- `node:before-execute` - Before any node executes
- `node:after-execute` - After any node executes
- `node:on-error` - When node execution fails
- `node:on-edge-taken` - When node returns an edge
- `node:on-state-change` - When node modifies state

#### State Management Hooks
- `state:before-update` - Before state modification
- `state:after-update` - After state modification
- `state:on-lock` - When state keys are locked
- `state:on-snapshot` - When state snapshot is created
- `state:on-rollback` - When state is rolled back

#### Custom Event Hooks
- User-defined events with custom namespaces
- Cross-node communication via events
- External system integration hooks

### 5. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create `HookManager` class in shared package
2. Implement basic hook registration and execution
3. Add event emitter for internal events
4. Create hook type definitions and interfaces

#### Phase 2: ExecutionEngine Integration
1. Add hook execution points in ExecutionEngine
2. Implement workflow lifecycle hooks
3. Add node execution hooks
4. Test with existing workflow examples

#### Phase 3: StateManager Integration
1. Add state change detection and hooks
2. Implement state watchers with diff detection
3. Add conditional triggers based on state changes
4. Performance optimization for frequent state updates

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add hook prioritization and ordering
2. Implement conditional triggers with filter functions
3. Add hook composition and chaining
4. Create hook performance monitoring

#### Phase 5: Environment-Specific Hooks
1. Server-specific hooks (file system, database, etc.)
2. Client-specific hooks (DOM events, localStorage, etc.)
3. Cross-environment event propagation
4. Security considerations for hook execution

### 6. Usage Examples

#### Workflow Monitoring Hook
```typescript
hookManager.register('workflow:after-end', {
  name: 'workflow-metrics',
  handler: async (context) => {
    await metrics.recordWorkflowCompletion({
      workflowId: context.workflowId,
      duration: context.duration,
      finalState: context.finalState
    });
  }
});
```

#### State Change Trigger
```typescript
hookManager.register('state:after-update', {
  name: 'error-detection',
  condition: (context) => context.changes.hasOwnProperty('errors'),
  handler: async (context) => {
    if (context.state.errors.length > 0) {
      await notifications.sendAlert(context.state.errors);
    }
  }
});
```

#### Custom Business Logic Hook
```typescript
hookManager.register('node:after-execute', {
  name: 'audit-trail',
  nodeFilter: ['auth', 'payment'], // Only for specific nodes
  handler: async (context) => {
    await auditLog.record({
      action: context.nodeId,
      user: context.state.currentUser,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      result: context.result
    });
  }
});
```

### 7. Architecture Benefits

- **Non-intrusive** - Hooks don't modify core workflow logic
- **Composable** - Multiple hooks can respond to same events
- **Testable** - Hooks can be registered/unregistered for testing
- **Performant** - Conditional execution reduces overhead
- **Secure** - Hook execution sandboxing in production
- **Observable** - Full visibility into workflow execution
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new hook types and triggers

### 8. Files to Create/Modify

#### New Files:
- `/shared/src/hooks/HookManager.ts`
- `/shared/src/hooks/types.ts`
- `/shared/src/triggers/TriggerEngine.ts`
- `/shared/src/triggers/StateWatcher.ts`
- `/shared/src/events/EventEmitter.ts`
- Tests for all new components

#### Modified Files:
- `/shared/src/engine/ExecutionEngine.ts` - Add hook execution points
- `/shared/src/state/StateManager.ts` - Add state change triggers
- `/shared/src/types/index.ts` - Add hook and trigger types

## Design Principles

### Event-Driven Architecture
The hooks system follows an event-driven architecture where:
- Core engine components emit events at key execution points
- Hooks register to listen for specific events
- Multiple hooks can respond to the same event
- Events carry rich context about the execution state

### Separation of Concerns
- **Core Engine** - Focuses purely on workflow execution logic
- **Hook System** - Handles cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, etc.)
- **Business Logic** - Implemented in nodes and custom hooks
- **Integration Logic** - Handled by environment-specific hooks

### Performance Considerations
- Hooks execute asynchronously where possible to avoid blocking workflow execution
- Conditional hooks reduce unnecessary overhead
- Hook prioritization ensures critical hooks execute first
- Performance monitoring tracks hook execution time

### Security and Isolation
- Hooks run in controlled execution contexts
- Error in hooks don't crash workflow execution
- Hook access to workflow state is read-only by default
- Environment-specific security policies for hook execution

## Integration with Existing Architecture

The triggers and hooks system integrates seamlessly with the existing shared architecture:

### Multi-Environment Compatibility
- Core hook system resides in `/shared/` package
- Environment-specific hooks in respective packages
- Same hook API across all environments
- Event propagation across environment boundaries

### Existing Component Integration
- **ExecutionEngine** - Emits workflow and node lifecycle events
- **StateManager** - Emits state change events
- **NodeRegistry** - Supports node-level hook registration
- **Error Handling** - Hooks can provide custom error handling

### Backwards Compatibility
- Existing workflows continue to work without modification
- Hooks are opt-in functionality
- No performance impact when no hooks are registered
- Gradual adoption path for existing systems

This implementation will provide a powerful, flexible system for extending workflow behavior without modifying core execution logic, supporting the agentic nature of the workflow system.
