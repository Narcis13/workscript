# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the Agentic Workflow Engine, a node-based workflow execution system that processes JSON-defined workflows. The engine enables flexible, conditional workflow execution through a modular architecture where nodes represent units of work and edges determine execution flow.

The Agentic Workflow Engine provides a declarative approach to workflow orchestration, allowing complex business logic to be defined in JSON format and executed through a TypeScript-based runtime. The system encompasses workflow definition, parsing, validation, execution, and state management capabilities, supporting conditional routing, loops, and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to implement custom workflow nodes, so that I can extend the engine with domain-specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new node class THEN it must extend the abstract `WorkflowNode` class
2. WHEN implementing a node THEN it must define the `metadata` property with required fields (id, name, version)
3. WHEN implementing the `execute` method THEN it must accept `ExecutionContext` and optional `config` parameters
4. WHEN the `execute` method completes THEN it must return a Promise resolving to an `EdgeMap`
5. IF the node has inputs or outputs THEN they must be declared in the metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want nodes to declare their metadata, so that I can understand node capabilities and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining node metadata THEN it must include `id`, `name`, and `version` fields
2. IF a node has a description THEN it must be included in the `description` field
3. IF a node requires specific inputs THEN they must be listed in the `inputs` array
4. IF a node produces outputs THEN they must be listed in the `outputs` array
5. WHEN referencing a node in a workflow THEN the system must validate it exists in the registry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a node developer, I want access to execution context during node execution, so that I can read inputs and manipulate shared state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node executes THEN it must receive an `ExecutionContext` object
2. WHEN accessing context THEN it must provide `state`, `inputs`, `workflowId`, `nodeId`, and `executionId`
3. WHEN modifying state THEN changes must persist across subsequent node executions
4. IF a node reads from state THEN it must access the current state values
5. WHEN a node writes to state THEN the changes must be immediately available to other nodes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to define conditional execution paths, so that workflows can adapt to different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node returns an edge THEN the engine must route to the corresponding configuration
2. IF an edge route is defined with `?` suffix THEN it is treated as optional
3. IF a node returns an edge without a defined route THEN execution continues to the next node
4. WHEN defining edge routes THEN they can be a string (node name), array (sequence), or object (nested config)
5. WHEN executing an array edge route THEN nodes must execute in the specified order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to define workflows in JSON format, so that I can create workflows without programming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a workflow THEN it must include `id`, `name`, and `version` fields
2. IF initial state is needed THEN it must be defined in the `initialState` object

5. IF a workflow references a node THEN that node must be registered in the node registry

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to configure nodes with parameters, so that I can customize node behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a node THEN non-edge parameters are passed to the node's config
2. WHEN a node executes THEN it receives configuration parameters through the `config` argument
3. IF a parameter key ends with `?` THEN it is treated as an edge route, not a configuration parameter
4. WHEN parsing node configuration THEN the system must separate parameters from edge routes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to implement iterative processes, so that I can process collections and repeat operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node returns a `loop` edge THEN the engine executes the defined loop sequence
2. WHEN loop execution completes THEN the same node is called again
3. WHEN the node returns a non-loop edge THEN the loop terminates
4. IF a `loop?` route is defined THEN it can be a node reference, array, or nested configuration
5. WHEN executing loops THEN shared state must persist across iterations
