# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a JSON-based agentic workflow execution engine. The system will execute workflows defined in JSON files using a node-based architecture where each node is a self-contained unit of work that makes decisions about execution flow through edge-based routing. The engine will support shared state management, optional routing, loop constructs, and flexible node configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define workflows in JSON format, so that I can create executable business processes without writing complex code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON workflow file is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the workflow structure
2. WHEN the workflow contains required fields (id, name, version, workflow) THEN the system SHALL accept the workflow definition
3. IF the workflow contains invalid JSON syntax THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message
4. WHEN the workflow references non-existent nodes THEN the system SHALL return a validation error before execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to create reusable workflow nodes, so that I can build modular and maintainable business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node class extends WorkflowNode THEN the system SHALL register it as available for use
2. WHEN a node implements the required metadata and execute method THEN the system SHALL allow it to be instantiated
3. WHEN a node is executed THEN it SHALL receive an ExecutionContext with state, inputs, and execution metadata
4. WHEN a node completes execution THEN it SHALL return an EdgeMap defining possible next steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow executor, I want the system to manage shared state across nodes, so that data can flow between different steps in the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow defines initialState THEN the system SHALL initialize the shared state with those values
2. WHEN a node modifies the shared state THEN subsequent nodes SHALL have access to the updated state
3. WHEN multiple nodes access the same state property THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency
4. WHEN a workflow execution completes THEN the final state SHALL be available for inspection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to control execution flow through edge routing, so that I can create conditional and branching logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node returns an edge name THEN the system SHALL route to the corresponding configuration
2. WHEN an edge route points to a single node name THEN the system SHALL execute that node next
3. WHEN an edge route points to an array of nodes THEN the system SHALL execute them in sequence
4. WHEN an edge route points to a nested configuration THEN the system SHALL execute the nested workflow
5. IF no route is defined for a returned edge THEN the system SHALL continue to the next node in sequence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to create iterative processes using loop constructs, so that I can handle batch processing and repetitive tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node returns a "loop" edge THEN the system SHALL execute the sequence defined in the loop route
2. WHEN the loop sequence completes THEN the system SHALL call the original node again
3. WHEN a node returns a non-loop edge during iteration THEN the system SHALL exit the loop and follow that edge
4. WHEN a loop executes THEN the shared state SHALL be maintained across all iterations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the engine to provide comprehensive error handling, so that workflow failures can be diagnosed and recovered from.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node throws an exception THEN the system SHALL catch it and return an error edge
2. WHEN an error edge is defined THEN the system SHALL route to the error handling configuration
3. WHEN no error handling is defined THEN the system SHALL terminate the workflow with an error status
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log sufficient information for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register and discover available nodes, so that I can understand what functionality is available for workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL discover and register all available node classes
2. WHEN a node is registered THEN its metadata SHALL be available for query
3. WHEN requesting node information THEN the system SHALL return metadata including inputs, outputs, and description
4. WHEN a workflow references a node THEN the system SHALL validate that the node exists in the registry

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a workflow executor, I want to execute workflows through a REST API, so that I can integrate workflow execution into other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to execute a workflow THEN the system SHALL start workflow execution
2. WHEN workflow execution begins THEN the system SHALL return an execution ID for tracking
3. WHEN requesting execution status THEN the system SHALL return current state and progress information
4. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL return the final state and execution results

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want flexible node configuration options, so that I can customize node behavior for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node is configured with parameters THEN those parameters SHALL be passed to the node's execute method
2. WHEN a node configuration includes edge routing THEN the system SHALL use those routes for flow control
3. WHEN edge routing is optional (ends with ?) THEN the system SHALL allow missing routes without error
4. WHEN node parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and return appropriate errors

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive workflow validation, so that I can catch configuration errors before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON structure against the schema
2. WHEN node references are invalid THEN the system SHALL return specific validation errors
3. WHEN edge routing contains circular references THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue
4. WHEN required node parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL validate and report missing parameters
