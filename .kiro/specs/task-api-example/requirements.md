# Requirements Generation Prompt

You are an expert software requirements analyst. Your task is to transform a software specification into a comprehensive requirements document with user stories and acceptance criteria.

## Input
You will receive a software specification document that describes what needs to be built.

## Your Task
Create a requirements document following this exact structure:

### 1. Document Header
Start with:
```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction

[Brief 2-3 paragraph introduction explaining what the system does and the purpose of this requirements document]

## Requirements
```

### 2. Requirements Format
For each requirement, use this structure:

```markdown
### Requirement [Number]

**User Story:** As a [type of user], I want [functionality], so that [business value].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition/action] THEN [expected result]
2. WHEN [condition/action] THEN [expected result]
3. IF [condition] THEN [expected result]
4. WHEN [condition/action] THEN [expected result]
```

### 3. Requirements Guidelines

#### User Story Rules:
- Start with "As a..." format
- Identify specific user types (developer, admin, end user, etc.)
- Focus on the "what" not the "how"
- Include clear business value in "so that" clause
- Keep stories small and focused on single functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria Rules:
- Use WHEN/THEN format for actions and expected outcomes
- Use IF/THEN format for conditional requirements
- Make criteria specific and testable
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Number each criterion for easy reference

### 4. Coverage Areas
Ensure requirements cover:

1. **Core Functionality** - Main features described in the spec
2. **User Management** - Authentication, authorization, roles (if applicable)
3. **Data Operations** - CRUD operations, data validation, persistence
4. **Integration Points** - APIs, external systems, data exchange
5. **Error Handling** - Invalid inputs, system failures, recovery
6. **Performance** - Response times, concurrent users, data limits
7. **Security** - Access control, data protection, audit trails
8. **Usability** - User experience, accessibility, help systems

### 5. Requirements Numbering
- Number requirements sequentially (1, 2, 3...)
- Group related requirements together
- Use descriptive requirement titles after numbers

### 6. Quality Checks
Before finalizing, ensure each requirement:
- [ ] Has a clear user story with identified user type
- [ ] Includes 3-5 specific acceptance criteria
- [ ] Is testable and measurable
- [ ] Doesn't specify implementation details
- [ ] Relates to specification goals
- [ ] Has no ambiguous terms ("fast", "easy", "good")

## Output Example

```markdown
### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define workflows in JSON format, so that I can create executable business processes without writing complex code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON workflow file is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the workflow structure
2. WHEN the workflow contains required fields (id, name, version, workflow) THEN the system SHALL accept the workflow definition
3. IF the workflow contains invalid JSON syntax THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message
4. WHEN the workflow references non-existent nodes THEN the system SHALL return a validation error before execution
```

## Special Instructions

1. **Be Comprehensive** - Extract ALL functionality mentioned in the spec
2. **Be Specific** - Avoid vague language; use concrete, measurable criteria
3. **Think Testing** - Write criteria that a QA engineer could turn into test cases
4. **Consider Edge Cases** - What could go wrong? What are the limits?
5. **Maintain Consistency** - Use consistent terminology throughout

## Final Checklist
- [ ] All major features from spec are covered
- [ ] Each requirement has a complete user story
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Requirements are numbered sequentially
- [ ] No implementation details are specified
- [ ] Error cases are covered
- [ ] Performance requirements are included where relevant

Generate a complete requirements document based on the specification provided. Be thorough and systematic in your analysis.

### Input Context:

## Specification

# Task Management API Specification

## Overview

A RESTful API for managing tasks with user authentication, task CRUD operations, team collaboration features, and real-time updates. The system will support individual users and teams, with role-based access control and comprehensive task tracking capabilities.

## Core Features

### User Management
- User registration with email verification
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)

### Task Management
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Task properties: title, description, status, priority, due date, assignee
- Task statuses: Todo, In Progress, Review, Done
- Task priorities: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- File attachments support
- Task comments and activity history
- Task labels/tags for categorization

### Team Collaboration
- Create and manage teams
- Invite team members via email
- Assign tasks to team members
- Team-wide task visibility
- Permission levels within teams
- Team dashboards and analytics

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Real-time task status changes
- Instant notifications for task assignments
- Live collaboration on task comments

### Search and Filtering
- Full-text search across tasks
- Filter by status, priority, assignee, due date
- Sort by multiple criteria
- Saved filter presets

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
- Framework: Express.js or Fastify
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational data
- Cache: Redis for session management and real-time features
