- Testing: Jest for unit tests, Supertest for integration tests

### API Standards
- RESTful design principles
- JSON request/response format
- Consistent error handling
- API versioning (v1)
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Rate limiting for API protection

### Performance Requirements
- API response time < 200ms for standard operations
- Support for 1000 concurrent users
- Real-time updates delivered within 100ms
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Pagination for large datasets (default 20 items)

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS only
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
